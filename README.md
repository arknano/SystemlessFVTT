# Systemless Foundry VTT System

Systemless is designed to be completely game-agnostic; perfect for simple games or for extending with modules. Rather than providing you with character sheets and item types with assumed stats like HP or skills, it simply provides generic Actors & Items for you to do with as you wish. Perfect for using Foundry as a virtual tabletop for games that don't have a system available (or if you want to use external tools like D&D Beyond to manage sheets).

Right now, at least, it's just [Boilerplate](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate) with the D&D-esque templates ripped out.
