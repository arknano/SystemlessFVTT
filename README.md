# Systemless Foundry VTT System

Systemless is designed to be completely game-agnostic; perfect for simple games or for extending with modules. Rather than providing you with character sheets and item types with assumed stats like HP or skills, it simply provides generic Actors & Items for you to do with as you wish. Perfect for using Foundry as a virtual tabletop for games that don't have a system available (or if you want to use external tools like D&D Beyond to manage sheets).

**Note:** Unlike some other game-agnostic systems for Foundry, Systemless does not provide any tools to create custom character sheets or the like. Actors get a text box and a list of Items, and Items get a text box. That's it! If you're looking for something that allows you to build your own advanced sheets directly within Foundry, check out [Sandbox](https://gitlab.com/rolnl/sandbox-system-builder/-/tree/master), [Simple Worldbuilding System](https://github.com/foundryvtt/worldbuilding) or [Custom System Builder](https://gitlab.com/custom-system-builder/custom-system-builder/).

Right now, at least, it's just [Boilerplate](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate) with the D&D-esque templates ripped out. Thanks to the contributors of that project!
